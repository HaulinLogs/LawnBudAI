# Cursor Rules for LawnBudAI

This project uses a comprehensive set of development rules. **All team members must follow the rules in RULES.md** before coding.

See the root `RULES.md` file for complete mandatory rules including:
- Research-First Before Implementation (always use Context7/WebSearch)
- All Test Execution Must Use Subagents (never run tests directly)
- Environment Variables Must Be Sourced (protect credentials)
- Evidence-Based Claims Only (verify everything)
- When in Doubt, Ask First (no assumptions)
- Consistency Matters (don't repeat mistakes)

## Quick Reference

🔴 **NEVER:**
- Start implementation without researching in docs first
- Run tests directly with bash (`yarn test:playwright`)
- Put credentials on command lines
- Claim work is done without showing proof
- Proceed when uncertain

✅ **ALWAYS:**
- Use Context7 MCP or WebSearch for documentation
- Use Task tool with subagent for any test execution
- Source environment variables from .env files
- Verify changes by reading files after editing
- Ask for clarification when uncertain
