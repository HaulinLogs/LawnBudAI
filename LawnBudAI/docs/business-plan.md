# LawnBudAI Business Plan

## Executive Summary

**LawnBudAI** is a mobile app (iOS + Android) designed to help residential homeowners manage lawn care with minimal effort. The app integrates real-time weather data with smart reminders to tell users exactly what to do and when — removing guesswork from mowing, watering, and fertilizing schedules.

**Revenue Model**: Free during BETA (May-Aug 2026), freemium subscription starting public launch (Aug 2026)
**Monetization Timeline**: December 2026 (once user base is established)
**Year 1 Goal**: Cover operational costs (~$200-300/month) while building a user base for sustainable growth

## Problem Statement

### The Homeowner's Lawn Dilemma
- **83 million** owner-occupied homes in the US; ~60% have maintained lawns (50M homes)
- Homeowners struggle with:
  - **No unified system** — decisions based on memory, guesswork, or vague recommendations
  - **Weather blindness** — water too much after rain, mow too short, fertilize at wrong times
  - **Inconsistent schedules** — gaps between care events, leading to degraded lawn health
  - **Information scattered** — lawn care advice from multiple sources, often contradictory
- Current solutions are either **too simple** (calendar reminders) or **too complex** (professional services)

### Target User Profile
- **Primary**: Homeowners aged 30-55, suburban, care about curb appeal and property value
- **Secondary**: First-time homeowners (25-35) who don't know where to start
- **Psychographics**: Tech-savvy, own smartphones, willing to spend ~$3/month for convenience
- **Household Income**: $75K+
- **Addressable Market**: ~5 million homeowners (5% of 50M who maintain lawns)
